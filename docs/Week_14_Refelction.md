# Brief Description (Text Entry)

## Write a short paragraph (3â€“5 sentences) explaining:

### What your custom feature is/ How it works/ Any known bugs or next steps

This feature lets users compare the weather in two cities side by side. You type in two city names, and the app shows their current weather in two color-coded cards, one green and one blue, so it's easy to tell them apart. Each card shows the main weather info like temperature, conditions, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. Everything works smoothly right now, but some aesthetic changes need to be made so there is a better flow. Next steps include adding weather icons that match the descriptions and make it easier to get a quick read on the weather.
