# Week 12 & 13 reflection

## GitHub Repository
    README.md updated with desctiption and basic file structure as well as Wireframe mockup. 

## UI Wireframes or Mockups
    Wireframe added to screenshot folder in repo

## API Demo & Core Functionality Check-In

Video demo of API attached to canvas submission. 

    -How API call is implemented
        requests library is used to send a request to openweathermap API After user clicks refresh button. API is pulled from .env to keep key safe. Weather is displayed in tkinter and saved to data/weather_data.json for backup and offline usage.
    - Blocker,challenges, and next steps
        Biggest challenge was handling errors like invalid city or API issues (invalid key or network problems). I added error messages in the gui. My next step is implementation of feature one City comparison and finding out how I can add wearther icons to the gui based on weather description.
