# Week 15 Reflection

## Status Update (Text Entry)

### Write a short status update paragraph (3–5 sentences) covering:

        -What features are done

        -Progress on your personal enhancement

        -Any blockers, plans for completion, or questions for feedback

Features 2 and 3 are up and running. The city comparison lets you see side-by-side weather for any two cities, and the Weather Rewind view covers the past 7 days, a 30-day summary, and what the weather was like this day last year. For historical data, I had to use the Meteostat API since OpenWeather’s free tier doesn’t support that. My personal enhancement—animated weather icons—works, but I’m still trying to make the animation smoother and stop it from looping nonstop. Overall, it’s coming together well, but there's still a lot of work left.
