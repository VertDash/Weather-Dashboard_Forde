## Section 1: Week 11 Reflection
### Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?
   
    - This project is largely an individual effort. I initially thought the entire project was a team effort. 
    - I learned that with the features we have some creative freedom, as long as meet the necessary requirements outlined. 
    - I was not aware we would be starting from scratch with all code. I assumed there would be some type of framework for a foundation. Creating an architecture and flow will be a learning experience.

### Concept Connections: Which Week 1–10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?
   
    - I feel the strongest in Basic Pandas and SQL basics
    - With Python I have both strengths and opportunities which I feel like will get better with repetition.
    - I need more practice in algorithmic thinking, Matplotlib, and machine learning.

### Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)? 
    
    - The biggest challenge so far is the folder setup Ive seen 3 different approaches so far. Patrick's, Asha's, and Jeremy's. Im not sure why each chose their particular approach and what the advatages or disadvatages are for each. I have a mix of the bunch for my setup, I just ensured to include all of the required folders and files.
    - Antoher challenge is trying to think in a way that allows me to see what I want my approach to be before taking action. In carpentry, I have to study my approach before I start construction because it helps me save time, enerygy, and material. It took some mistakes to get to a level where Im efficient, and I still have moments where i move to quick and have to backtrack. This process is very similar, but unfortunately I dont have the same amount of experience yet so my vision is limited. 
    

### Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?

    - previous week’s assignments and class code examples will be a great help.
    - I will be leaning on my peers as well through slack and breakouts for help when Im stuck.
    - Attending office hours may be tough but I can keep an eye out for the hours that happen after 4 and before class. 
    - I will also be using google, youtube, and AI as resources for information and direction. 


## Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale

| #   | Feature Name       | Difficulty (1–3) | Why You Chose It / Learning Goal                                      |
|-----|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Simple Statistics  | 1                | Its a base function i would expect of any weather app. Also give practice reading and processing data |
| 2   | City Comparison    | 1                | Lets me compare where I am vs where im going another main feature. Helps me Learn to handle and compare multiple datasets |
| 3   | Weather Icons      | 2                | Visuals appeal to my artistic side. Helps me build skills in visual representation and animation |

|     | **Enhancement**    | –                | Add small animations to weather icons (e.g., sun pulsing, rain moving) for better interactivity (please dont hold my feet to the fire on this one )|

## Section 4: Data Model Plan

file and table names not concrete 

| File/Table Name          | Format | Example Row or Structure                                     |
|--------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| weather_data.json        | json   | {"city": "Boston", "temp": 82, "condition": "Sunny"}        |
| city_comparison.json     | json   | {"city1": "Boston", "city2": "Seattle", "temp_diff": 10}     |
| weather_icons_map.csv    | csv    | Sunny,sun_icon.png                                           |

## Section 6: Risk Assessment 


| Risk                         | Likelihood | Impact | How I’ll Handle It |
|------------------------------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **UI not working properly**  | Medium     | Medium | I’ll build the interface in small steps and test each part as I go. If something breaks, I’ll go back to the last version that worked and add pieces more carefully. |
| **Time management**          | High       | High   | I’ll break tasks into small chunks each week and set realistic goals. I’ll also leave buffer days in case something takes longer than expected. |
| **API rate limits or key problems** | Medium     | Medium | I’ll test the API early and save results to a file, so I don’t need to call it every time. I’ll also keep a backup plan with example data if the API breaks. |
| **Error handling and feature creep** | Medium     | High   | I’ll focus on getting core features working first. If I have time later, I’ll add extras. I’ll also write basic error checks so my app doesn’t crash if something goes wrong. |

## Section 7: Support Requests


I’m still trying to connect all the different skills we’ve learned so far. I’ll be relying a lot on my past assignments, class examples, and help from peers to get through this project. Based on where I’m at, these are the areas where I think I’ll need the most support:

- **Folder and file structure:** I’ve seen multiple approaches and I’m not always sure which one is best or why. I may ask for help reviewing my setup to make sure it’s clean and scalable.

- **Code organization:** I want to make sure I’m not writing too much in one script. I’ll need help splitting up code into smaller functions and modules.

- **Debugging logic or errors:** Sometimes I know what I want to do, but I don’t know how to write it in code. I’ll likely ask for help figuring out why something isn’t working or how to simplify it.

- **API usage and data handling:** I may need help pulling data from an API and turning it into something I can work with (like a cleaned JSON or CSV file). I’ll also want to avoid calling the API too much.

- **Basic visuals or UI issues:** If I run into problems making the interface work or linking visuals (like icons) to the weather conditions, I’ll ask for guidance there too.

- **General encouragement or clarity:** Sometimes I just need to hear that I’m on the right track — or to ask “is this how I’m supposed to do it?” I plan to use office hours, Slack, and peer check-ins to stay grounded.
